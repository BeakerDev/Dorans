Dorans
------

Dorans is a Java implementation for the [Riot Games API][riot-games-api]. The goal of Dorans is to seperate the API calls to the Riot API from the generation of Java objects from the JSON allowing you to store the raw JSON. 

Dorans is still in active development and is not currently stable.
